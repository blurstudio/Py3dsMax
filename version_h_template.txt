/*
Versioning is handled through a couple of files and a pre-build event 
to allow svn revision numbers to automatically be included/incremented.

version.h: this is an auto-generated file with the build date and svn 
	revision number of the project.It is included throughout the project 
	to get the version and build info it defines.

version_h_template.txt: Template used when building version.h

buildVersion.py: Uses "git describe --long" to generate the major, minor, 
	patch, and revision values used by version_h_template.txt and generates
	the version.h file used when compiling. This is called in a pre-build
	event.

Git tags: Git tags should always follow this format. v[major].[minor].[patch]
	replacing the contents of each [] with a version number.
